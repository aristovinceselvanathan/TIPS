# File Data Processor

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of a C# console application that processes data files. The application uses various stream types, including FileStream, MemoryStream, and BufferedStream, to perform operations such as reading, processing, and writing files. The tasks included in this project are intended to deepen understanding of working with files and streams in C#.

## Task 1: Implement a File Data Processor

### Task Description

**Objective**: Create a console application that reads data from a source file, processes the data, and writes the processed data to a new file. The application should:

1. Implemented a method that uses FileStream to read a large text file (minimum 1GB) in chunks using a buffer, measuring the time taken to read the entire file.
2. Add a method to use BufferedStream instead of FileStream and compare the performance of both versions.
3. Implemented a method to process the data read from the file, which could involve converting text data to uppercase or calculating statistics for numerical data.
4. Implemented a method that writes the processed data to a new file, using MemoryStream to buffer the data before writing.
5. Calculated the Preformance of the various file stream operations by using the stopwatch.

## Task 2: Implement a File Data Processor With Asynchronous Methods

### Task Description

**Objective**: Enhance the console application by using asynchronous methods of FileStream, MemoryStream, and BufferedStream. The application should:

1. Implemented asynchronous versions of the read, process, and write methods.
2. Modified the application to process multiple files concurrently.
3. Compared the performance of the synchronous and asynchronous versions of the code.

## Task 3: Investigate Issues in Basic File Usage

### Task Description

**Objective**: Identify and address inefficiencies in the starter code. This includes fixing memory issues.

1. Identified the issues in the code.
2. Modified the code accordingly to fix the memory issues.
3. Provide a clear explanation of how identified and fixed the issues.

## Task 4: Analyze and Resolve Performance Issues with Logging System for Multiple Users

### Task Description

**Objective**: Improve a logging system used by multiple users simultaneously. The starter code has various issues, and task is to:

1. Identified potential performance and concurrency issues in the starter code.
2. Modified the `LogError` method to write directly to the file to address memory inefficiencies.
3. Implemented a locking mechanism to ensure thread-safe file write operations.
4. Changed the logging system to have each user's errors logged in a unique file.
5. Performed a performance test to compare the initial system and the improved system.

## Understanding

### Working with Files and Streams

Working with files and streams in C# is a fundamental concept in software development. It involves the manipulation of data through various types of streams, which act as channels for data input and output. Understanding these streams and their efficient use is critical for handling large data files, optimizing resource consumption, and achieving better application performance.

## Descriptions of Various Streams Used

In this project, we work with several types of streams:

1. **FileStream**: This stream is ideal for reading and writing files directly. It provides low-level access to files, making it suitable for reading large data files in chunks using a buffer. FileStream allows precise control over file operations and is efficient for sequential access.

2. **BufferedStream**: BufferedStream is used to wrap other stream types (e.g., FileStream) to improve I/O performance. It utilizes an internal buffer, reducing the number of read and write operations to the underlying stream, making it more efficient when dealing with small and frequent I/O.

3. **MemoryStream**: MemoryStream is an in-memory stream that allows data to be read from and written to memory as if it were a file. It is useful for buffering data, especially in situations where you want to store data temporarily before writing it to a file. In this project, MemoryStream is employed to buffer processed data before writing it to a new file.
In C#, there are several important types of streams that allow you to work with data, whether you're reading from or writing to files, memory, or network connections. These streams are part of the `System.IO` namespace and are essential for input and output operations. Here's an overview of some common streams in C#:

4. **StreamReader and StreamWriter:**
   - These are higher-level abstractions built on top of `FileStream` and are used specifically for reading and writing text data in files.
   - `StreamReader` makes it easy to read lines of text from a file, and `StreamWriter` simplifies writing text to a file.

5. **BinaryReader and BinaryWriter:**
   - These classes are used for reading and writing binary data to files. They work with various data types, including primitive types, strings, and custom structures.
   - `BinaryReader` reads binary data from a stream, while `BinaryWriter` writes binary data to a stream.

Each of these stream types serves a specific purpose and is designed to make reading from or writing to various data sources as straightforward and efficient as possible. When working with streams, it's crucial to handle exceptions and ensure that you properly close or dispose of the streams to release resources when you're done with them.

## Real-time Use Case

- **Reading Logs**: Use FileStream to efficiently read log files from different sources. The ability to handle large log files is crucial for monitoring and debugging.

- **Buffering and Processing**: Buffer log entries using MemoryStream for efficient processing. You can perform operations like filtering, formatting, or aggregating logs before storing them.

- **Concurrency**: In a multi-user or multi-service environment, asynchronous processing ensures logs are captured and processed without blocking, enhancing system performance.

- **Thread Safety**: Implement thread-safe mechanisms when multiple users or services write logs concurrently to prevent data corruption or contentions.

- **Efficiency**: Efficient file operations help reduce the overhead of storing logs, making the system more scalable and responsive.

## Conclusion

Working with files and streams in C# is a core skill in software development, especially when dealing with large datasets or log management. This project not only provides practical experience in reading, processing, and writing files but also emphasizes the importance of asynchronous programming and efficient memory usage.

By implementing and comparing synchronous and asynchronous versions of file operations, the project showcases the benefits of asynchronous programming in handling concurrent tasks and the advantages of various stream types in optimizing I/O operations.

Furthermore, identifying and addressing inefficiencies in the code highlights the significance of memory management and thread safety, ultimately leading to more efficient and robust applications. In real-time scenarios like log aggregation systems, these skills are invaluable for maintaining the integrity and performance of software systems.

In conclusion, this project equips developers with essential skills for handling files and streams, improving application performance, and addressing common issues encountered in real-world applications. It emphasizes the importance of best practices, efficient code, and sound understanding of memory management in C#.
