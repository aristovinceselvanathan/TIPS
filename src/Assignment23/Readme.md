# Assignment: Building and Using Custom Analyzers in C#

## Objective

To gain a deep understanding of C# analyzers and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainability.

### Task 1: Understanding the Basics

1.1. Research and understand what analyzers in C# are, their purpose, and how they work. Write a summary of your findings.

1.2. Install a pre-existing analyzer (like StyleCop or FxCop) in a sample C# project. Document any issues found by the analyzer and how they were resolved.

### Task 2: Building a Simple Analyzer

2.1. Create a new analyzer project using the .NET Compiler Platform SDK.

2.2. Write an analyzer that detects if any method in the code has more than 10 lines of code. If it does, the analyzer should raise a warning.

2.3. Test the analyzer on a sample C# project and document the results. Include screenshots of the warnings in the IDE.

### Task 3: Building a More Complex Analyzer

3.1. Create an analyzer that detects if any class in the code violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This will require a deeper understanding of the SRP and how to detect violations of it in code.

3.2. Test the analyzer on a sample C# project and document the results. Include screenshots of the warnings in the IDE.

### Task 4: Building a Code Fix Provider

4.1. For the analyzer created in Task 3, create a code fix provider that suggests a possible refactoring to resolve the SRP violation.

4.2. Test the code fix provider on a sample C# project and document the results. Include screenshots of the code fix suggestions in the IDE.

### Task 5: Integrating Analyzers into the Development Process

5.1. Research and document how to integrate custom analyzers into the development process, including how to include them in the build process and how to distribute them to other developers.

5.2. Implement the integration of the analyzers created in Tasks 2 and 3 into a sample development process. Document the steps taken and any issues encountered.

Deliverables:

· The analyzers and code fix provider created in Tasks 2, 3, and 4.

· The documentation from Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

· The sample C# projects were used to test the analyzers and code fix provider.

This assignment should provide a deep, hands-on understanding of C# analyzers and their role in improving code quality and maintainability.

# Project Documentation

## Introduction

In C#, an **analyzer** is a tool that performs static code analysis on source code and reports any issues to the user. It can be used to enforce coding standards, identify potential bugs, and improve code quality. The .NET Compiler Platform SDK provides the tools you need to create custom analyzers, code fixes, code refactoring, and diagnostic suppressors that target C# or Visual Basic code.

## Understandings

In C#, **Roslyn** is a platform that provides APIs for performing **static code analysis** on source code. It allows developers to create custom **analyzers**, **code fixes**, **code refactoring**, and **diagnostic suppressors** that target C# or Visual Basic code.

An **analyzer** is a tool that performs static code analysis on source code and reports any issues to the user. It can be used to enforce coding standards, identify potential bugs, and improve code quality. The rules you implement can be anything from code structure to coding style to naming conventions and more. The .NET Compiler Platform provides the framework for running analysis as developers are writing code, and all the Visual Studio UI features for fixing code: showing squiggles in the editor, populating the Visual Studio Error List, creating the "light bulb" suggestions and showing the rich preview of the suggested fixes.

## Code Description

## Real-Time Example

1. **Code quality**: Roslyn analyzers can be used to enforce coding standards, identify potential bugs, and improve code quality. For example, you can create an analyzer that checks for the use of `var` keyword in your code and suggests using explicit types instead.

2. **Performance optimization**: Roslyn analyzers can also be used to optimize code performance. For example, you can create an analyzer that checks for the use of `string.Concat` method in your code and suggests using `StringBuilder` instead.

3. **Security**: Roslyn analyzers can be used to identify security vulnerabilities in your code. For example, you can create an analyzer that checks for the use of `System.Web.Security.AntiXss.AntiXssEncoder.HtmlEncode` method in your code and suggests using `System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` instead.

4. **Custom rules**: You can create custom rules that are specific to your project or organization. For example, you can create a rule that checks for the use of `Console.WriteLine` method in your code and suggests using a logging framework instead.
