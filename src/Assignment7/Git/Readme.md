## Documentation Report

## Overview

The assignment that can able to understand the concept of the git in Visual Studio by the use of the git changes window. Became familiar with the git changes window.

## Requirements

1. Git Repository
2. Visual Studio
3. Project Files (Git Files)

## Description about the methods in Program Class

The main method just prints the required information like Hello World, How are you, etc.

## Implementation Considerations

- Resolving the merge conflicts between the branches
- Staging the required files
- Creating a new branch from the current branch
